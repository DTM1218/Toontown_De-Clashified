Testing:
- CogPageManagerAI.py crashes when a boss is defeated due to missing the key 'isSkelecog' (Tested on The Director so far)
- Test the new taskline to make sure everything works correctly (use magic words to skip annoying parts)
Unresolved:
- Mr. Hollywood's shades crashes clients (it loads the model, but won't instance it for some reason)
- New camera sometimes stuck in the ground after battle (difficult to fix)
Low priority:
- The zap movies sometimes prematurely jump to the death animation (just a visual bug)
- Tutorial with new camera is broken (skipped for now, develop new tutorial later)
- With 2 instakill sounds, only the first goes off (very minor bug)
