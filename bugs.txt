- Only the first cog gets its actions caulculated
- When a gag kills, the movie ignores playing any toon-up clips
- The zap movies sometimes prematurely jump to the death animation
- Going sad takes max toons to 120 laff???
Low priority:
- 5+ cogs might be broken in BattleCalculatorAI (5+ cogs are currently unused)
- Toontorial with new camera is broken (just skip it for now)
- New camera stuck in the ground after battle (difficult to fix)
- With 2 instakill sounds, only the first goes off (not a serious bug)
