##Backstory
Toons have broken into Sellbot HQ time after time, and from the resulting security concerns, the Chairman plans to relocate the Cogs production line.  He then informs Bravecog of his new role in the business:
(Bravecog - VP, Robert - Chairman)
Bravecog:  “Why are you halting cog production in the factory?  The Oil reserves here wont dry out for another five centuries!”
Robert: “Otto has informed me that you’ve been unable to stop the toons for years now.  I’d prefer to keep the production of my most valuable assets away from pesky toons.”
Bravecog: “Well, my supply of Sellbots can only do so much.  Why do the others get the strongest henchmen?”
Robert: “Bravecog, please. If the problem was the Sellbots, then why have our company shares skyrocketed?”
Bravecog: “...Perhaps they are better suited for marketing than confronting toons?”
Robert: “Listen. Your colleagues have seen massive success in the upper areas of town.  It's about time you see it, too.  I'm sending you the new designs for our Sellbot line, including the new Field Specialists and Operations Analysts.”
Bravecog: “Oh, my!  Is it time for me to get my very own elite team to stop the pesky toons?”
Robert: “Well, I have the blueprints for developing them, but you'll have to build them yourself.”
Bravecog: “Me? I'm the Senior V.P. of COGS, inc.  Pass it down to one of our associates.”
Robert: “Have you not received my memo?  The company has already well advanced since I've hired you, and I have a new V.P. here in my boardroom.”
Bravecog:  “Wha–but–how—If I'm not the V.P., then what IS my title, Bob?”
Robert: “Hmm... Your current position is the Chief Marketing Officer, or the Marketing Director, if you prefer.”
Bravecog: “Fine!!!  I guess I'll be the Marketing Director.  We have too many Chiefs leading each branch of the company.”
Robert: “Very well then. I will have you speak with our benefactors regarding oil shipments soon enough.  If you succeed, we will mutually benefit.”
Bravecog: “You’ve got it, Bob!  I'll fill you in on my future successes with my new operatives.”
Robert:  “Oh, and get those head joints checked out. They don't seem as flexible as they used to.”
Bravecog: “What? Nobody has told me all this time! I guess I'll have to take a visit to the new production plant myself.”

#Factory Rework
##Modified Rooms
The Cog Factories have halted production of cogs to shift to Oil production only.  As a result, rooms have been repurposed to fit the theme.
**Paint Mixer -> East Oil Processor**
**Paint Storage Room -> East Storage Room**
**Lava Room Foyer -> Gauge Room**
**Lava Room -> West Oil Processor**
**Lava Storage Room -> West Storage Room**
**Oil Room -> Distillation Room**

##Back Entrance/Rooms
A new entrance has been added, making the number of entrances total 3 and allowing each suit part to be divided like the other facilities.  The Back entrance has more cogs level 7 and 8, and the warehouse/silos have level 9 cogs.  The new rooms are as follows:
**Back Entrance Room**
**Refinery** - Same shape as the Duct room, holds 4 cogs
**Surveillance Alley** - Same size as Stomper Alley, only has high-up conveyor belts with Goons below.
**Shipment Room** - Same Layout as Gear Room, holds 3 cogs plus second (optional) set of 4 cogs at the top of the stairs.  This connects directly to East Silo for a faster short route.
**Desalting Room** - Same Layout as Distillation Room, holds 4 cogs
**Warehouse Storage Room** - Same layout as other storage rooms, can only be opened once all the Back Entrance cogs are cleared.  The door is located between the Warehouse silo doors

Some restock barrels have been changed:
Lobby hall: Throw Barrel
East Storage Room: Lure and Zap Barrels, Jellybean Barrel, Laff Barrel, Leg Part Barrel
Stomper Alley: Squirt and Laff Barrel
West Storage Room: Sound and Drop Barrels, Jellybean Barrel, Laff Barrel, Arm Part Barrel
Surveillance Alley: 2 Laff Barrels
Warehouse Storage Room: Trap and Toon-Up Barrels, Jellybean Barrel, Laff Barrel, Torso Part Barrel
All gag barrels give 4-6 gags.
Jellybean barrels give 75-100 jellybeans each.

**Routes**
Defeating the Factory Foreman itself no longer drops suit parts.  Instead, to obtain a piece, the toons must clear all the cogs in a section of the factory, and then make it to the end.  The part type depends on the factory section:
**Front Entrance:** Defeat the cogs in the Foyer, Gear Room, and Boiler Room to unlock the East Oil Processor, where the Leg Parts are stored.
**Side Entrance:** Defeat the cogs in the Duct Room, Pipe Room, Gauge Room, and Distillation Room to unlock the West Oil Processor, where the Arm Parts are stored.
**Back Entrance:** Defeat the cogs in the Refinery Room, Shipment Room, Desalting Room, and Warehouse to unlock the Warehouse Storage Room, where the Torso Parts are stored. 
NOTE: Toons can opt to clear multiple sections to retrieve multiple suit parts at once.

#VP Reworked--Now The Director of Marketing (DM)
The toons enter the Marketing Director’s office, where they find Byers B. Ware trying to free Rain from her cage without getting caught.

##Byers B. Ware
The bright red bear the accompaies the toons. A resourceful rookie in the toon resistance, Byers carries portable gadgets from TV commercials with varying degrees of success (literally in some cases).

The Director is holding a virtual proposal meeting with an unknown benefactor in which he is offering shipments of Oil & Gas.  The benefactor points behind Bravecog and notes that his captive is acting squirmy.  He turns around to see Byers climbing a retractable ladder that eventually falls over.  As Byers breaks into a sprint, the Director locks him into another cage.  The toons in disguise approach the Marketing Director only to be unwittingly called out by Byers.  The Director scoffs at the toons once revealed, and then calls in cogs to attack them.

###Fight 1:
Like the original VP, it features cogs level 5-11/12/13 depending on tier.

The VP makes his way to the elevator to block the exit.  As he does so, Byers uses one of his portable gadgets to break free from his cage.  He tells the toons he's got a supply of pies ready for collecting.

###Catch Game:
Byers Brings tosses out a portable pie launcher and the toons flock to collect some pastries.  Shakers stomp in to trip toons up as they run around, dealing 4 damage on contact.  Collecting cake slices will increase the supply meter by 2, which affects the amount of cakes the toon gets per reload.
If the toons collect any pies, it will decrease the demand meter by 5 and increase the supply meter by 5.  Demand will affect how much a pie costs in the final round.
The supply and demand meter sizes increase in size depending on tier.(20/40/60)

Byers tosses down his portable fridge to store the cakes and pies, and the Director calls for express shipments: mini-skelecogs.

###Fight 2:
As in the VP, toons will have to fight level 7-11/12/13 skelecogs depending on tier.
Sometimes, a level 5.exe Affiliate mini-skelecog with 50 HP will exit VP’s hatch and take a fifth spot.  They have extra defense, but only deal 1-4 damage.  Using sound or zap tends to be the easiest way to remove them.

The Director is fed up with toons and their antics and tells them that if they want their friends back, they’ll have to go through him.  Rain and Byers then explain how they can push the MD out of his balcony.

###The Final Fight:
**Objective:**  Similar to the original, send him flying off the platform, only with some obstacles are in the way.

**Gags:**  Toons can collect their gags by walking up to the cooler.  They can always grab cake slices (35 damage, 18 knock back, 2 laff points) in batches of 20-45 depending on the supply level.  They can also collect fruit pies (50 damage, 25 knock back, 3 laff points) by trading in price tags.  Pies will cost 1-to-5 price tags each depending on the demand level for that toon.

**Cogs:**  Regular Cogs will defend the Director by hovering low and swooping towards toons below.  Enough throw gags will defeat them and make them drop treasures, and give the attacker price tags.  The more HP the cog has, the better the drops.

**The Director:**  (1500/2000/2500 HP + obstacles)
He is immune to damage, but by hitting his undercarriage, he gets stunned.  Until he does get stunned, he will do the following:
He could spin to release a rain of gears.  He first does this when waking up.
He throws a set of gears that target a single toon.
If a toon bumps into one of his sides, he gets down and swipes at them.
If all the toons are out of range, he will jump to start rolling forward. His speed depends on how close he is to the final edge.
If the Director is outside, he may turn on oil sprinklers near him which will repeatedly hit toons in a cone-shaped area briefly.
When the Director gets stunned, he will begin taking knock back damage. Several road blocks lie between the Director and a steep fall:
There’s a door right before the balcony that will open up as he hits it. He will recover immediately afterward.  If he rolls in front of the door, it closes, and toons must open it again. (1/2 HP)
The Director must hit the balcony railing a total of 3 times for it to break. After bumping into the balcony railing, the Director will recover and begin to quickly roll forward.
As the Director gets lower on HP, he will recover faster (he also will immediately recover after fewer hits).

When the Marketing Director is defeated, Rain and Byers escape, congratulate the toons, and give them these rewards based on the battle tier:
Byers gives 3 3/4/5-star SOS cards
Rain gives her SOS card (Tier 3 only)
(Boosters increase the number of Byers SOS cards by 1)

#Overclocked Director (ODM)
The toons enter the executive penthouse, where they will take the elevator to the Marketing Director’s Suite.

When they arrive, Byers B. Ware meets the group at the front door, letting them know about the Marketing Director's expenses meeting.  Byers found a crate of pies in cold storage, and he has to reheat them in his portable oven.   Before entering, the toons are alerted to Rain's capture yet again.  Rain tells them to continue on and that she will find a way out as usual.
The Director welcomes the executives into his place, where he reveals the graphs showing the level of cog success in the takeover.  While the Director is distracted in his presentation, Byers sneaks over to the oven to bake some pies.  The beeping noises alert Bravecog soon enough, and he calls on the other executives in the room to attack the toons.

**First battle:**  The toons are split into 4 groups of 2.  One executive will fly into action at a time. All of the toons must defeat 3 level 12.exes, 2 level 15.exes, and a level 18.exe per group, all of which are immune to fires and sues. Regular cogs level 8-11, 9-14, and then 10-16 will periodically fly into battle based on the executive cog.

The Director, spectating the incompetency of his workers, begins moving toward a button on the wall, which he slams out of frustration.  He remarks on the toons' gall to waltz into his office when he was about to present his latest line of Sellbot managers.  A hatch opens in the ceiling, and the marketing team flies in from above.

##The Blitz Campaign Team:
#Blitz Campaigner (30.mgr, 2900)
Blake Broker is the definition of trigger-happy when it comes to business deals. He is eager to go out and share news about trendy products, but won’t stop to hear what you have to say.  Can you catch up to him?
“You were bound to find me—I’m going everywhere!”
Blitz Campaigner always attacks twice per turn, once if he's lured.
Blitz Campaign - “We’re flooding the markets!” - Every 2 turns, before the cogs attack, he drenches the healthiest toon in paper ads, making them a priority target for the next turn.  He will then use this move on 2 other toons with the most laff if no other cogs were hit.
Market Storm - “Can you feel it?  There's electricity in the air!” - He takes full zap damage even when chained to.  When hit with a zap gag, one of his attacks will deal 20 damage, and chain to drenched toons, who then lose their status.  He will also do this immediately if 3 or more toons get drenched.
Acceleration - "Time is running short, pick up the pace!" - When the Blitz Campaigner is in Desperation or is below half HP (1450), the battle timer is reduced to 15 seconds per round.
Desperation - Campaigner drenches two toons every 2 rounds.  He also takes 10% more damage from zap gags.
Attacks:
Tremor, 15
Rolodex, 18
Paradigm Shift, 16
Buzz Word, 17

#Astroturfer (20.mgr, 2120/1060/530/280/140/70/35)
Allen Aggregate is set to be the most popular cog out there—according to himself.  When he isn’t lost in his own social circle, he’s advocating for the company’s top grossing products.  Good luck trying to get a hold of him!
“I've got my own friends on the line.”
He stops taking damage at half his HP and can only be lured for 2 rounds.
Astroturf - “I suppose I should call in back up!” - Every time his HP drops to half, he shrinks down a bit, and his new max HP is set to the current amount.  Then, he summons a clone of himself (with the same amount of HP but 80% attack power) that can be defeated.  Defeating one of these clones disables the others for a turn (but not the main one).  He stops calling once he reaches 35 HP.  The clones don't take up the battle spots for normal cogs.
Phone Jam - "I'm going to have to cut your meeting short." - If he takes damage after reaching half his HP, he will disable SOS attacks for 3 rounds.
Focus Group - “You have our attention!” - Astroturfers will instead target the toons who used sound on them, dealing 20 damage each.
Desperation - Astroturf now creates 2 clones instead, each with 50% his max HP (round up) but the same attack power.  The original Astroturfer gains +1 lure resistance as well.
Attacks: 
Filibuster, 25
Synergy, 20
Hot Air, 30
Mumbo Jumbo, 23

#Snake-Oil Salesman (25.mgr, 2750)
Distant relative to a certain infamous money launderer, Silvester Sidewinder is a more honest trader.  He is true to his name and will supply his own prime oil to all needy cogs.  His gratuitousness may quickly become overwhelming.
“This cure-all will keep cogs in tip-top shape.”
He will immediately attack toons who attack him directly, plus he can only be lured for 2 rounds.
Snake Oil - “Alright, bucketheads.  Drinks on me.” - On his attacking turn, he will siphon 50 HP to give the all other cogs 50 HP.  If they have full HP, this will promote them to executive; otherwise, heal an extra 25.  If there are no more cogs to heal, he'll just attack toons instead.
Quick Oil - “Feelin' better?  I’ll make sure my coworkers do.” - For each toon that gets buffed or loses a status effect, supply a random cog with a free oil boost of 25 health.
Snake Glare - “You ain’t escapin’ today, toon.” - At the end of every 4 turns, paralyzes the lowest laff toon in fear, making them take 1.5x damage in the next hit.
Desperation - Oil’s effects are doubled, adding 100 health with a bonus of 50.  Snake Glare lowers his defense for the next turn.  He also gains +1 lure resistance.
Attacks:
Power Trip, 30
Glower Power, 35
Double Talk, 32
Evil Eye, 33

#Data Miner (25.mgr, 2800)
Darrel Dealmaker spends long periods of time planning ahead, trying to account for all the variables.  This makes him formidable in the world of network tunneling and data analysis.  If you’re his next target, get ready for a world of pain!
"Request received: identify toons, then dispose of them."
He only attacks a toon with a mining process, but he can be lured for only 2 rounds.
Data Mining - "Begin process installation..." - On his first turn awake, he starts a mining process, and a meter on his helmet starts glowing.  While the mining process is active, he gains +20 defense.  The mining process reveals a weakness in the lowest laff toon by disabling the highest level gags they currently have.  The mining process will complete once the affected toon takes 80 damage.
Data Wipe - “Critical error. Restarting...” - To break the meter, the toon must help hit a total of 80 combo bonus damage.  Once his meter breaks, he will be inactive for 2 rounds.
Data Report - "Mining process complete. Requesting super-users for immediate removal." - Once the mining process is complete, a level 15 executive Sellbot with super-user privileges will enter the fight (cannot be sued or fired, lure only lasts 2 turns).  This cog will substitute the weakest cog that occupies a battle spot.  The miner then goes inactive for the next round.
Desperation - Mining requires 100 points to break, and Data Report summons 2 level 15 super-user Sellbots.  Breaking the Mining process disables Data Miner for an extra turn.  He also has +1 lure resistance.
Attacks:
Freeze Assets, 32
Tabulate, 34
Crunch, 36
Dig Up, 38

**Interactions:**
While Zap may be used to effectively destroy Astroturf cogs, hitting the Blitz Campaigner with zap will trigger his Market Storm.
Blitz Campaigner’s Market Storm will remove drench effects, making Snake-Oil Salesman use Quick Oil for each toon who lost it.
If the lowest laff toon is healed to become the most laff toon, they become more likely to be hit by Blitz Campaign and take more damage for the Mining process.
With each Astroturf clone, the Astroturfer gains an effective +50 healing from Snake Oil, +75 if they are above their current HP cap.
It becomes harder to break the Datamining process with sound combo damage if Astroturfer’s around since he will deal even more damage if hit with sound.
Snake Glare will help Data Miner's process finish faster.  The mining process finishing will trigger Quick Oil, but not when you break it.

——
##Catching game:
Once the marketing team is defeated, Cold Callers surround the oven, fill it with hot air, and it begins spitting out burning pies.  Pies on fire hurt for 2 laff points, but toasted pies are salvageable.  While this happens, a few First-Movers stomp around to trip up toons in a bigger area.  Getting shaken deals 6 laff points.
Collecting toasted pies increases the supply meter by 5.  The demand meter will decrease by 2 points a second, but if the toon gets hit, it increases by double the amount of damage taken.  The supply and demand meters both have a total of 100 points.

The Director gives one final warning, saying he will bring the storm if they try to do anything funny.  Rain enters the room, planting a wedding cake tree in a nearby flower pot.  Finally, the Director, having enough of the toony nonsense, snaps and dozens of cogs fly in from the ceiling hatches to swarm the toons.

##The Final Fight:
**Objective:**  Similar to the normal Director fight, send him flying off the platform, only this time, many more obstacles are in the way.

**Gags:**  Toons start with burnt fruit pies (40 damage, 20 knock back, 1 laff point) that can be reloaded by visiting the fridge.   Based on the number of pies the toon recovered from the catch game, they can throw 15-30 burnt pies per reload.  They can also collect cream pies (90 damage, 45 knock back, 3 laff points) from the fridge at the cost of 1-5 price tags depending on their demand level.   If all toons obtain enough price tags from defeated cogs, toons can go collect a wedding cake from the tree (170 damage, 85 knock back, 40 laff points).  Wedding cakes fly through cogs and will also “mark for laff” any cogs when hit for 30 seconds.  If a wedding cake hits the Director, it will extend his next stun time by 5 seconds.  Cream Pies will cost more price tags the more they’re obtained.  Byers will pick up and move the fridge as toons advance.

**Cogs:**  Regular Cogs will defend the Director by diving towards the toons from high above.  Enough throw gags will defeat them and make them drop price tags and treasures.  Field Specialists stay up high and drop an explosive oil drum on toons below.  Operations Analysts will fly in to protect the Director's undercarriage when he recovers, but they do not drop price tags or treasures.

**The Director:** (3000 HP + LOTS of obstacles)
He uses spruced-up versions of his attacks from the original fight:
He will jump 1/2/3 times, depending on how close he is to the final edge (Warning comes in 2 yellow/3 red !s above the toon.)
He throws a spread of gears that can hit multiple toons.
He swipes rapidly until toons move back if they come close.
If the Director is outside, similar to the normal fight, he will turn on oil spouts near him which will repeatedly hit toons in the area.  The splash zones are large circular geysers rather than a spray cone in a direction.
His gear undercarriage has gears that boomerang back into him.
When the Director gets stunned, he will be pushed back as usual. The difference is, toons have to push him through some tough obstacles on the way to the edge:
A large ascending slope that leads to the balcony, the Director will constantly roll down and need to be knocked back up it quickly. (2500 to 1500 HP)
His giant metal-framed doorway is tough, and he needs to be hit with enough power (800 damage) in one stun to break through it. He will recover immediately afterward. (1000 HP)
The Director must hit the rubber cement balcony railing a total of 3 times for it to break. After bumping into the balcony railing, the Director will bounce off and fly back to the doorway.  Once it breaks, the Director will immediately recover and jump 3 times.  He begins to jump more often out of desperation.

When the Director is defeated, Byers and Rain congratulate the toons and give them these rewards:
Byers gives 3 5-star power-up SOS cards
He also gives 1 5-star acc-up/dmg-down SOS card
He also gives 2 3-star restock SOS cards
Rain gives 8 of her SOS cards
(Boosters increase the number of power-up cards by 1)
